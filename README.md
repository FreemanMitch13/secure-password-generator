# secure-password-generator
## Goals  
  The goal of this homework was to create a password generator that creates a random secure password based on a few prompts from the user.
### Criteria
  This project required the creation password generator imn javascript that created a random password for the user after they selected a few prompts (length, use uppercase, use numeric characters, use special characters). The password could be any length between 8 and 128 characthers and could used any or all of the other types of characters that the user desired.
#### Technology
  In this project, I was provided with a working html file, a working css file, and a javascript file that was complete expect for the function that generated the password. I added a form to the html file to allow the user to select the different properties for their password. In the javascript file I created the function that generated the password and displayed it on the screen. I created variables linking the html entries and add if statements to add those entries to the final password. I created a for loop that was used to create the password by using the allowable characters at random.
